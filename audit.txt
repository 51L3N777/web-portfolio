Task 1: Perform a Design and Usability Audit

Is my navigation menu clear and easy to find on every page?
	Yes, I have added a sticky bar to make it easier for the viewer to change pages and makes it easier to find contents.

Is there a clear visual hierarchy? (e.g., Are <h1> headings obviously more important than <h2>
headings?)
	Yes, although I did not use many header formats I did not mix and match the headers and made the title the biggest header and everything else just big enough for the viewers to read.

Is the text easy to read? (Consider font size, line spacing, and color contrast).
	Yes, even though I added extra animation I believe it is easy to read, I have shared my web-portfolio with other people and they have told me it is easy to read and interactive enough.

Task 2: Conduct an Accessibility Check

Ensure every <img> tag has a descriptive alt attribute. If an image is purely decorative, it should have an
empty alt="" attribute.
	Yes

On your contact.html page, double-check that every <label> is correctly associated with its <input> or
<textarea> using the for and id attributes.
	Yes
