An ## About This Project section with a brief, one-paragraph description of your portfolio
website.
Website is relatively simple and would need a lot of work to make it look nice. 
An ## What I Learned section with a bulleted list of the top 3 most important skills you learned
during this course.
It was a good refresher and there is a bunch of new stuff that came out such as the meta tags, as in the old html there did not exist one.
I would like to say I learned to use github but there is too much for me to learn.
I learned to link my vs code with github in order to make changes.
An ## Next Steps section. Based on this week's topics (JavaScript, frameworks, etc.), briefly
describe one new feature you would add to your portfolio if you had more time.
I woulkd like to actually sit down and make it more appealing to the eye and makje it more in teractive to the viewier in oredr for me to learn new methods to have user interact with website.
